<h1>WordWeaver-AI - a neural network for text editing</h1>

<p>Based on the Llama2-7b model, created for editing texts written by ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4 for further commercial use.</p>

<p>The prompt contains your request that you want to ask, you can also change the number of words in max_length (default is 500).</p>

<p>The neural network itself is in my profile on ðŸ¤—Hugging Face, where the dataset on which I retrained the neural network is also available.</p>
